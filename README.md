# DemoAI-API
A simple web API hosted on an EC2 instance on amazon AWS, which hosts several basic AI applications of computer vision.

The link to the API is the following: http://54.89.115.131:8000

For the moment the web API contains these applications:
- One app to classify birds among the 11 following species: *pipit-rousseline, alouette-lulu, tarier-des-pres, locustelle-luscinoide, rousserolle-turdoide, grive-litorne, sterne-naine, bondree-apivore, goeland-leucophee, goeland-argente, grimereau-des-jardins*.
Just go to the corresponding link and upload a picture of a bird from one of these species.
- One app to detect key points on faces. Just upload an image containing a human face and see the result.
